# Kai Barnes - Portfolio

This is a portfolio site I made to use when applying for jobs.

I designed each section to fit on one page when on a computer, and to scroll on mobile.

Each transition between pages is styled using react-transition-group.
Understanding how to use this together with React Router was the most challenging part of developing this site for me, however it encouraged me to understand how React Router works in more detail than before.

If you have any questions about this site, or any interest in hiring me, I'd love to hear from you.

You can contact me here on Github or through the website itself at the url above.
